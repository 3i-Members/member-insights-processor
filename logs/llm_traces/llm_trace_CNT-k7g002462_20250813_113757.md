- Tory Reiss is currently working on: Both
  * [2025-07-26,ENI-5611162603392302145,recurroo]
- This is the bio for Tory Reiss: Tory Reiss is a three-time founder of VC-backed financial technology companies. Although he didn't study finance at Northwestern, as a Jew that didn’t go into medicine, it was inevitable he end up in finance. He's currently the CEO of Equi, a private alternative investments platform for RIAs and Family Offices specializing in niche ($100M-$2B AUM) uncorrelated hedge fund strategies around the globe.

Outside of business, Tory was born in New Mexico and grew up in Colorado, so is a true eagle scout/hippie combo.  When not in the office you can find him camping, skiing, kitesurfing, and paragliding or training calisthenics (if anyone wants a workout buddy). Tory is an active advocate for criminal justice reform and financial literacy in public education. He’s been teaching financial literacy “bootcamps” for over a decade.

- Tory Reiss submitted a request with the description My friend is looking for a CEO to step in and run a business he’s currently incubating. Here’s the summary:
_Short answer is Plaid for Death. 
We have so many asset and social accounts now and it’s a horrible process after someone passes away to properly transfer those accounts to the estate. Only trending to have more digital presence in the coming years. And death isn’t going anywhere. In fact, we’re entering the largest generational wealth transfer in history and that will just continue.
Need something that can seamlessly and securely provide access to these accounts upon death. Verify death, verify trustee, authenticate and facilitate. Would bundle the cost into in life insurance, health insurance, Corp benefits, etc. Would be the plumbing for identity transfer. Pro/Con is that it would be like Crowdstrike. Powering this for socials like Facebook/IG, banks/trading platforms, etc.
Product team is ex-Paypal, LifeLock, FICO, BlockFi. Cracking the architecture now and have a few paths forward. Literally paying them out of my own pocket. If we can get the right CEO, we will launch the company and do a seed and start building. We will put up the first $1m and would probably be able to do $5m on $25m post. Have a good pipeline of devs in the space from PayPal/BlockFi.
Just need the right CEO!_. Here is a description on the final solution of the request: Sent N&L draft 8/23
